<!-- (dl (# TestFailContainer)) -->
**TestFailContainer**: Container for failed tests, supporting nested failure structures and grouping by name.

<!-- (dl (# TestSuccessContainer)) -->
**TestSuccessContainer**: Container for successful tests, supporting nested success structures and grouping by name.

<!-- (dl (# TestIgnoreContainer)) -->
**TestIgnoreContainer**: Container for ignored tests, supporting nested ignore structures and grouping by name.

<!-- (dl (# RunResults)) -->
**RunResults**: Holds the results of a test run, including lists of failures, successes, ignored tests, the random seed, and timing information.

<!-- (dl (# RunnerEventLifecycle)) -->
**RunnerEventLifecycle**: Represents the lifecycle events of a test runner, such as start, per-test events, and end.

<!-- (dl (# RunnerExecutionDelegate)) -->
**RunnerExecutionDelegate**: Delegate type for handling runner event lifecycle notifications.

<!-- (dl (# RunnerTestArgs, RunnerTestResultArgs, RunnerTestCancelArgs, RunnerTestResultCancelArgs)) -->
**RunnerTestArgs, RunnerTestResultArgs, RunnerTestCancelArgs, RunnerTestResultCancelArgs**: Event argument types used for runner events, providing access to test and result data.
