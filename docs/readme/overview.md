Archer.Types is a foundational library for F# testing frameworks, providing a set of common types that are shared and reused across the Archer ecosystem. These types are designed to promote consistency, type safety, and ease of use when building and running tests.


<!-- (dl (# Key Features)) -->
- **Unified Type Definitions:** Centralizes core types for assertions, test results, runners, and more.
- **Extensible:** Designed to be extended by other libraries and frameworks in the Archer suite.
- **F#-Friendly:** Leverages F#'s strong type system and functional paradigms.

<!-- (dl (# Main Type Categories)) -->
- **PublicTypes:** Types intended for use by consumers of the framework, such as test authors.
- **InternalTypes:** Types used internally by the framework to manage test execution and results.
- **RunnerTypes:** Types related to test runners and execution flow.
- **Helpers:** Utility types and functions to support common operations.

<!-- (dl (# Usage)) -->
Reference Archer.Types in your F# test projects to access these shared types and ensure compatibility with other Archer libraries.
